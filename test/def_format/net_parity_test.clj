(ns def-format.net-parity-test
  "Parity test for the def-format.net migration to def_format/net.kotoba
   (ADR-2608261100).

   The original `def-format.net` constructors and `net-fanout` are portable
   pure value shuffling (maps/strings/vectors + one `count`). The parity port
   compiles for the js-browser target; on the JVM test side this test drives
   the actual compiled artifact (amu compile -> node) and asserts it agrees
   with the Clojure original on the same inputs.

   Document-value convention (matching the compiled artifact's JSON view):
   a doc map is [\"map\" [[ [\"keyword\" \":k\"] value ] ...]] with entries
   sorted by keyword name; i64s arrive as strings.

   The one disclosed gap: the original's `net` coerces a nil `routed` to []
   via `or`; the port types `routed` as a required :document, so the caller
   passes an explicit empty vector. The parity assertions cover the
   explicit-empty-vector path on both sides.

   Set AMU_BIN to override the compiler location."
